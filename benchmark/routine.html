        <h1>How I Start My Day</h1>
        <h2>Getting Out of Bed</h2>
        <p>        I wake up at 5:45 every morning. I usually hit the snooze button on my alarm and sleep in for an extra five minutes, though. After I get up (for real this time), I pick out my outfit for the day. I'll grab my towel off my desk chair and head to the shower after this.</p>
        <h2>Morning Hygene</h2>
<p>        I do my best every morning to look and smell good before I leave the house. I know it's not the best for your hair or body, but I'm in the camp of boiling myself every morning. I usually use head and shoulders, but if I've got something important planned, I'll use a nicer coconut shampoo. I can spend anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour on my hair alone, making sure to remove any knots and tangles I can. Because my hair is thicker, it's more prone to matting, so I have to be diligent with this. After my hair is done, I'll spend at least another 10 minutes washing my body. I prefer to use a washcloth over a loofa, because I feel it lets me get a firmer scrub. I like to use zote soap because it is easy to buy and hard to run out of.
        I also brush my teeth in the shower, usually while rinsing my hair. Just a regular old toothbrush and some colgate toothpaste gets the job done. When it comes to drying off, I try to get my hair as dry as I can before I leave. Because it's so thick, I usually cant get to the roots with a towel, but I don't use a blowdryer. I find that using one dries my hair out too much, and my hair gets really staticy.
        Deodorant is also a must. I use antipersperant, which is a special type of deodorant that just stops you from even sweating in the first place. After I'm all set and dressed, I'll grab my towel and head back to my bedroom.
        </p>
        <h2>Finishing Touches</h2>
<p>        After I hang my towel over my chair, I'll grab my glasses and a hairtie off the nightstand, and my belt off my top bunk. Glasses go on my face, hairtie over my right wrist, belt around my waist. I'll spend around five minutes petting my cat and prepping anything else I would need for the day. I'll grab my briefcase and head downstairs after this.</p>
        <h2>Breakfast</h2>
<p>        Because of how late I wake up (and how slowly I do), I cannot by any means consider myself to be a morning person. I am; however, a breakfast person. I'll add links to all the specific recipes at the bottom of the page for anyone who wants to try them, and they'll also be available on <a href="../index.html">Recipedia</a>.
        During the spring months, I'll make omelettes, usually with spam but always with mushrooms, onions, garlic, and spinnach. During the hot summer months, Nothing beats a big bowl of cereal. My top pick for cereal is definitely frosted corn flakes. When fall hits, pancakes are king. I make them with blackberries and a homemade cinnamon sugar whipped butter. When the end of the year approaches, and the mornings grow colder, a hot sandwich keeps your hands warm and is easy to take with you. No matter what I have for breakfast, it is imperative to leave the house with a clear mind and a full belly.<br>
        Thanks for reading my blog! As promised, I'll put the links to the recipes I use <a href="">here</a>. To see any of my other projects, follow <a href="">this link</a>. Until Next Time!</p>
