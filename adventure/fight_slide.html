        <h1>You run in close and slide under the brutish kobold.</h1>
        <p>Drawing your sword, you push off the ground and raise it 
        high above your head. You brace yourself as you fall back down, 
        poised to strike your sword through the monster's skull.</p>
        <p>Your feet make contact with the monster's arm as he reaches 
        up to protect himself. Your blade finds it's way into his forearm 
        as he releases a harsh roar. You are flung back as your ears 
        start to ring.</p>
        <p>The beast clutches it's bleeding arm as it readies itself.</p>
        <p>The Kobold Brute charges in at you. His maw is bigger than your 
        entire body. Steeling yourself, you take up your sword and dive in. 
        The Kobold devours you in a single bite. This would be his last.</p>
        <p>Crawling out of a mess of blood and gastric juices, you let out 
        your lunch. Looking over at Knight Maximan tells he didn't fare much better.</p>
        <p>"An ambush! What a horrible tactic! No honor with this... filth. 
        No use sitting about. In we go."</p>
        <p>If you feel like it, that is.</p>
        <a href="">Yeah, I'm not going in there.</a>
        <a href="">Down we go.</a>
