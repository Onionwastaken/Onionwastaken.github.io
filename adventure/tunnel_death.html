        <h1>You make your way into the tunnels... alone.</h1>
        <p>A sharp chill runs down your spine as you pull a 
        torch from your pack. Lighting the torch brings much 
        needed warmth to your hands. Slowly, you delve deeper 
        into the tunnel. You have only taken a few steps, when
        suddenly...</p>
        <h3>SLAM!</h3>
        <p>A kobold jumps down from the ceiling, ripping deep 
        gashes into your chest. You are doing everything you 
        can to cling to your life, but you are losing blood, 
        quickly. The kobold rummages through your bag, and as 
        you lose conciousness, you can see him hold up your 
        silver locket.</p>
        <p>Maybe you should've been a shepherd like dad.</p>
