        <h1>My favorite games, ranked.</h1>
        <p>This is a table containing a few of my favorite games. 
        Feel free to reccommend a game using the issue feature. 
        I'll see if I have time and I'll give it a go! I will also 
        try to keep most of the games on this list single player (or 
        games where there is co-op but the single player is also good.)</p>

                    <td>Hollow Knight: Silksong</td>
                    <td>9.5/10</td>
                    <td>Silksong is one of my most anticipated
                    games of all time, and it was well worth 
                    the wait. It takes everything that made 
                    its predecessor so good and runs with them, 
                    combining skillful platforming with fun and 
                    engaging combat. While it can be difficult 
                    for first-time gamers, the game provides the 
                    player with a multitude of areas to practice 
                    fundamentals in a safe environment with low 
                    risk, which eliminates skill issues given the 
                    player doesn't wuss out.</td>

                    <td>Ultrakill is one of my most played games. 
                    The game has a wide range of difficulty settings 
                    that allows players of almost any skill level to 
                    have fun and experiment with all the unique weapon 
                    interactions. The game encourages the player to 
                    find their own unique style and express themselves 
                    through the way they play with a highly customizable 
                    arsenal. Oh, and another thing, the game is still in 
                    early access, so expect more from it on the way.</td>

                    <td>9/10</td>
                    <td>Chibi Robo is a slower game than the previous two, 
                    being a sort of puzzle platformer where you must utilize 
                    household objects to collect gifts for your family and clean 
                    messes and trash to bring happiness to them. By collecting 
                    and cleaning, you can earn money to get further upgrades to 
                    make your job easier and reach new areas. This game plays 
                    fairly slow, and can feel tedious at times, but I feel the 
                    story greatly makes up for this.</td>

                    platformer, combining stratigic gameplay and a variety of 
                    playstyles to allow every playthrough to feel a little bit
