        <h1>You nimbly dodge the attack.</h1>
        <p>The massive axe lands before you, lodging itself firmly into the earth.
         The nearby impact sends a terrible shiver through your body. Abandoning the 
        axe completely, the kobold brute takes another swing at you with its massive 
        forearm. You don't have enough time to dodge again and are sent flying. As your 
        body is flung into the nearby foliage, you can see the smaller kobold ripping 
        away at knight Maximan. You land in a nearby tree, unable to breathe and rapidly 
        losing your vision.</p>
