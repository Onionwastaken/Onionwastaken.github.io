        <h1>You decide to report in to Knight Maximan.</h1>
        <p>Sparing no time, you go straight to the town's 
        outer south garrison. Knight Maximan is there waiting. 
        He seems distressed.</p> "Ah! Squire! How... fortunate, 
        I thought you would take all day to show up," he says, 
        looking down on you from on his steed, he starts again, 
        "You're aware of today's misson?"<br>
        You nod in agreement. Today you will venture into the 
        <strong>Reptillian Tunnels</strong>.<br>
        <a href="go_tunnel(wknight).html">I will accompany my knight through the worst of lands.</a><br>
        <a href="choice_defect.html">Sounds like a rough time... Better to sit this one out.</a>
