        <h1>The two of you stand before the fetid gates.</h1>
        <p>The stale air fills your lungs. A black 
        veil hides the interior of the large pipe. 
        In the distance, you can hear echoes, but 
        only faintly. You are grateful for Maximan's 
        company.</p>
        <p>"Lo, squire. There seems to be something nearby..."</p>
        <p>You watch as Maximan leads his horse into 
        the tunnel... he steps down and lights a torch...</p>
        <h3>SLAM!</h3>
        <p>A slender kobold drops from the tunnel roof, 
        dropping on top of Maximan. As you rush in to 
        help your knight right himself, a rather burly 
        looking kobold steps between the two of you.</p>
        <p>He raises his axe, and you make a split second descision.</p><br>
        <a href="fight_slide.html">Slide underneath him and counterattack.</a>
        <a href="fight_dodge.html">Dodge nimbly to the side and plant his axe firmly in the ground.</a>
