        <h3>What is Recipedia?</h3>
        <p>Recipedia is a website where anyone can submit their recipes for the internet to see.
         To submit a recipe, file an issue report using the template "Recipe Submission", or just 
        use the link at the bottom of the page. Your recipe will then be reviewed and added into 
        the catalog! To find a recipe, use the menu to navigate to your desired category, or use 
        the search feature to find specific recipes.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that I am only one person, and recipes may take some time to appear on the site.</p>
