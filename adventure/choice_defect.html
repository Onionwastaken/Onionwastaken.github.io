        <h1>You decide to duck out when you can.</h1>
        <p>The two of you begin on the path to the tunnels. 
        The sky slowly shifts to a sapphire shade of blue as 
        you help Maximan set the tent.</p>
        <p>"Squire! Set the pot. I'm feeling a bit peckish."</p>
        <p>Hmmm... Do you think anyone would find it suspicious 
        if Maximan dissapeared on his way there? If a group of 
        thieves killed him and his squire? Or if they never found 
        the squire's body?</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>No, you shouldn't be thinking like that! You are a servant 
        of the crown! If the truth is found they will certainly 
        have your head.</p>
        <p>But it wouldn't be such a bad thing to be free...</p>
        <a href="">Yeah... let's give it another go.</a><br>
        <a href="">Never! Such a treasonous act is a cardinal sin!</a>
