        <h1>Your name is Jona.</h1>
        <p>Today is your first day of serving under the great and powerful 
        knight Maximan. After spending a whole year in training, and your 
        entire life before that learning your way around a sword. Leaving 
        your humble cottage, you sling your bag over your shoulder.</p>
        Equipped <strong>Rapier</strong>.<br>

        Equipped <strong>Sling</strong>.<br>
        <p>Knight Maximan will surely be waiting on his squire... But surely you have time to test your skills first?</p>
